for those wondering, I edited the video, tuned the vocals, and made him join the marketing team at McDonalds

been very busy lately so i havent been able to upload much. this shoulda been uploaded a while ago lol

*this video is all for the funny haha

=======VERY important stuff=======

As with all my videos, I edit videos to create more parodic and more entertaining from original sources. Existing images, such as the burgers have been altered to make it anew and fit with the context of this video. Hours of research and planning for this video has been possible thanks to information provided by McDonalds official corporate websites. The compositions that goes into my videos are with the hope that those who view the end result find them humorous and enjoyable.

This Is What Makes Burger King's Whoppers So Delicious,"New menu offerings will always come and go, but one thing that is more or less a permanent fixture on the Burger King menu in the chain's signature burger, The Whopper. First introduced all the way back in 1957, The Whopper was the result of a redesign of how the fast food company cooked burgers. It's been a fan favorite menu item ever since.

Burger King co-founder Jim McLamore explained pretty simply that the name ""The Whopper"" was chosen to indicate that it was big, and that ended up being true in numerous ways. What explains its enduring popularity and staying power? Here's what makes Burger King's Whoppers so delicious.
